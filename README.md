The purpose of my assignment was to follow given UML diagram where something changed every week meaning I had to make necessary changes to the software.
There was also very little teaching on the subject and students were encouraged to self-study (=use google to search and study).

You can run the program from the .exe file. 
You can also run Catch-tests by running the program from command line with the argument
-tests
<pre>
MatrixCalculator.exe -tests
</pre>
